## Problem Statement
College clubs and student communities manage events, announcements, and attendance using scattered platforms like WhatsApp, Google Forms, and Instagram. This leads to missed updates, confusion about registrations, and inefficient event coordination.
## Solution Overview
CampConnect is a mobile-first Flutter application that centralizes club events, announcements, and attendance management into one intuitive platform. Using Firebase for real-time data sync and authentication, students can easily discover events, register, and stay updated, while club admins can manage events efficiently.
