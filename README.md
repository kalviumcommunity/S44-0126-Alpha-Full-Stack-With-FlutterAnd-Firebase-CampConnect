# S44-0126-Alpha-Full-Stack-With-FlutterAnd-Firebase-CampConnect

## Problem Statement

College clubs and student communities manage events, announcements, and attendance using scattered platforms like WhatsApp, Google Forms, and Instagram. This leads to missed updates, confusion about registrations, and inefficient event coordination.

## Solution Overview

CampConnect is a mobile-first Flutter application that centralizes club events, announcements, and attendance management into one intuitive platform. Using Firebase for real-time data sync and authentication, students can easily discover events, register, and stay updated, while club admins can manage events efficiently.

## Day 1 – Introduction to Flutter & Dart (2.8)

This milestone focuses on setting up the Flutter development environment and building the foundation for the CampConnect mobile application.

### What Was Implemented

- Flutter SDK installation and environment verification using `flutter doctor`
- Creation of a new Flutter project
- Modular folder structure inside the `lib/` directory:
  - `screens/` for UI screens
  - `widgets/` for reusable components
  - `models/` and `services/` for future scalability
- Implemented a basic **Welcome Screen** using `StatefulWidget`
- Added a simple UI interaction using `setState` to demonstrate Flutter’s reactive UI model

### Learnings

- Understood Flutter’s widget-based architecture
- Learned the difference between Stateless and Stateful widgets
- Gained familiarity with Dart syntax and UI composition
- Established a scalable project structure for future development
